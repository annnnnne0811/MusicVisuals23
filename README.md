# Description of the assignment
The theme we concluded for this assigment was "what we feel when we listen to the song" 


The song we choose to do for this assignment is a japanese song called "Shinunoga E-wa" by Fujii Kaze, the literal translation for "Shinunoga E-wa" is "I'd rather die", the song is based about how the artist Fuji cant live without the ones he loves. This song is a chill pop song to listen to, the visualizer assignment we did is based on our thoughts and what suited the vibe of the song.


To achieve this goal, we made a menu that gives the user 4 options 1. Anne, 2.Airish, 3.Mena, 4.Paris , by pressing one of the options it will bring you to one of the programmers thoughts about the song. 











# Instructions
The user will be presented with a menu containing options 1-4. This will allow the user to enter a key from 1-4 to choose.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
